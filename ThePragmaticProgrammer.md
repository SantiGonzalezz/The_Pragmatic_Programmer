  Think about what you’re doing while you’re doing it.
  Never run on auto-pilot.

<br>

- **Kaizen**
  Continously making many small improvements.

### The Cat Ate My Source Code

**Topic 2**

- Pragmatic philosophy is the idea of taking responsibility for yourself and your actions

<br>

- We can be **proud of our abilities**, but we must **own up our ignorance** and our mistakes.

<br>

- Your team needs to be able to trust and rely on you, and you need to be comfortable relying on each of them as well.

<br>

#### Take Responsibility

- When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it.

<br>

- **Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses**
  Don’t blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse.
  Any of these may play a role, but **it is up to you to provide solutions**, not excuses.
  <br>
  Before telling the bad news, is there anything else you can try?
  Sometimes, you just know what they are going to say, so save them the trouble.

    <br>

  - Don’t say it can’t be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation.
    <br>
  - Admit what you don’t know, but then take responsibility like a pro.
    **“I don’t know,
    but I’ll find out.”**

### Software Entropy

**Topic 3**

Software rot: disorder increase

- **Don't Live with Broken Windows**
  Ignoring a clearly broken situation reinforces the ideas that perhaps nothing can be fixed
  Fiex each one as soon as discovered.
  - Neglect accelerates the rot faster than any other factor.

#### First, Do No Harm

Don’t cause collateral damage just because there’s a crisis of some sort.

- Working on a project with broken windows, it’s all too easy to slip into the mindset of _"I'll just follow suit”_.
- Working on a project where the code is pristinely beautiful, you will take extra special care not to mess it up.
